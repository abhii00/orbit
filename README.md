# **Orbit**

A physics engine built to numerically solve many-body astrodynamics problems.

_February - October 2019_

```PYTHON, PYGAME```

## **Features** 

### **Implemented Features**

* 2D symplectic numerical integration of translational dynamics and gravitational forces for multiple bodies.
* Bounding box collision detection with elastic and absorptive collision.
* Object trails and randomised star field visuals.

### **Planned Features**

* Rotational dynamics.
* 3D space and visualisation perhaps using C++ and OpenGL.
* Area collision detection.
* Integration schemes with greater stability e.g. RK4.
* Controllable spaceship with built-in GNC algorithms.

## **Skills**
